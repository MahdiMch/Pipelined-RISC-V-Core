This repository hosts the implementation of a pipelined RISC-V core designed to execute instructions from the RISC-V ISA efficiently. 
Utilizing Verilog, a hardware description language (HDL), and developed using Quartus, this core targets FPGA/ASIC platforms.
By employing pipelining techniques, it enhances throughput and performance.
